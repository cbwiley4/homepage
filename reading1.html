"My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?" by Lauren Schwulst
</h2>
<p>

I like the idea that clarity isn’t the only possible intention for the website. You could make the website purposefully confusing and unpredictable. “They are both subject and object at once.” A website can look and behave however you want it to. In today’s age, the internet is controlled by corporations. These sites are geared towards monetization instead of user experience. Artists can translate their world-building skills into making websites. Having a website for an artist’s own work is beneficial because it allows you to control how your work is viewed. It is like being your own gallery organizer. I like the idea of a website being a finite room. It can often feel overwhelming being on the web and having so many things be interconnected. Websites don’t have to be complete when first published. It can grow as the needs grow.

<h2> "A Rant about Technology" by Ursula K. Le Guin </h2>

<p>
    This is a good reminder of how technology has become a misused term. Things like medicine, pens, paper, chairs, are all technology, no matter how mundane. We can respect simple technology. It goes unnoticed how it simplifies everyday tasks. When we change how we view the term “technology”, it becomes less daunting to think about working with and developing our own. Technology is not exclusive to things we consider hi tech.
